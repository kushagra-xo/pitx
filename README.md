## The Inspiration

The concept of PITX emerged from recognizing a gap in how photos and their narratives are traditionally managed. Observing that images often lack context when separated from their descriptions, the author envisioned a format that could unify these elements. PITX addresses this need by embedding descriptive text directly within the image file, ensuring that every photo is accompanied by its story.

- Reimagining Digital Galleries: PITX offers a new way to present photos, making galleries more informative and interactive.
